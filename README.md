# Boucher Vac German Project with Angular for Front End ðŸš€

In this project Angular and Angular Material have been used to create visual components with cards, tables and buttons.
Also, I have used HTML, CSS and Typescript for the performance.
Now, describing what this project is about, it is about creating a system to calculate financing bonds with the German method for the Finance course.
Finally, for the backend, the json server deployed on Heroku has been used.
